# README Generator

## Description
This is a javascript project that generates a custom `README.md` file and exports it in a folder. It takes input from user about the `title`, `description`, `installation method`, `usage`, `test scripts`, `GitHub profile link` and `license` and generates the markdown file. The user can then have the most part of the README file created and can go and just edit some minor details and add some screenshots.
